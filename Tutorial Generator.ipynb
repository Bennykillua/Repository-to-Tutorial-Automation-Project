    "## Repository-to-Tutorial Automation Project\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine turning any code repository into a polished, professional tutorial in a matter of minutes. This project uses the power of AI, using Google Gemini, to automate the transformation of software repositories into detailed, user-friendly guides.\n",
    "\n",
    "By analyzing code and file structures, it generates high-quality, interactive tutorials for developers and users to get started. This could be for onboarding or a quick start document.\n",

    "### Introduction to the Gemini Long Context API\n",
    "\n",
    "The Gemini Long Context API is a cutting-edge tool in natural language processing, specifically designed to handle extensive and complex datasets. With its focus on delivering high-quality generative and analytical capabilities, it enables developers and businesses to work effectively with large volumes of content. These APIs can process and retain meaning across long-form text inputs, making them suited for multi-file analysis or document-heavy tasks. They can also generate insights tailored to the provided content without sacrificing the quality of output. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### This Project does what?\n",
    "\n",
    "This project showcases the API's capability to transform a repository of code and documentation into a comprehensive, human-readable tutorial, emphasizing Gemini's utility in bridging technical content and user understanding. Its ability to process multiple files, summarize content, and respond accurately highlights the transformative potential of the Gemini Long Context API in real-world applications.  "

      "\n",
      "To generate content using the Google Generative AI API, you can use the `generate_content()` method of the `GenerativeModel` object. This method takes a prompt as input and returns a `GenerationResponse` object.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "### Starting a Chat\n",
      "\n",
      "You can start a chat with a generative model using the `start_chat()` method of the `GenerativeModel` object. This method takes a list of messages as input and returns a `Chat` object.\n",

      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### Executing Code\n",
      "\n",
      "You can execute code within a generative model using the `code_execution` module. This can be useful for performing complex calculations or for generating custom content.\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",

      "### Configuring Model Parameters\n",
      "\n",
      "You can configure the parameters of a generative model using the `generation_config` parameter of the `generate_content()` method. This parameter allows you to specify the number of candidates to generate, the maximum output length, the temperature, and other parameters.\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "# Configure the model parameters.\n",
